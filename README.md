# Mock Ticketing App using Microservices

From Stephen Grider's [Udemy course Microservice with Node JS and React](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/).

Add host to `/etc/hosts` on your host machine:
Run:

```sh
minikube ip
```

put that address (e.g. `127.0.0.1`) into `/etc/hosts` along with host name, be in administrator mode (i.e. `sudo vim /etc/hosts`):

```sh
127.0.0.1 ticketing.dev
```

On Chrome, will get "Not Secure", just click anywhere on the page and type `thisisunsafe`. Haven't checked what to do for Firefox, b/c the "thisisunsafe" didn't work for me.
